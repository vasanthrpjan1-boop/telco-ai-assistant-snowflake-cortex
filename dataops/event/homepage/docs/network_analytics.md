# <h1black>Analyze Network Performance with</h1black> <h1blue>Cortex Analyst</h1blue>

In this section you will learn how to build a dynamic network performance analyzer using Cortex Analyst. Traditional network monitoring relies on static reports and dashboards that require extensive configuration and technical expertise to modify.

Cortex Analyst's AI allows network insights to be generated by simply asking questions about your telecommunications data in natural language.

### <h1sub>Examine Network Performance Data</h1sub>

Navigate to the **Network Performance Analysis** notebook by going to **Projects > Notebooks**.

- Open the **TELCO_NETWORK_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS** notebook 
- Press **Start** in the top right corner to begin compute

Within this notebook, you will:

- Analyze network latency and throughput across regions
- Identify performance bottlenecks by network type (5G, 4G, 3G)
- Use AI to generate optimization recommendations
- Visualize network performance trends over time

### <h1sub>Key Network Metrics</h1sub>

The analysis covers critical telecommunications KPIs:

- **Latency** - Response time across different network technologies
- **Throughput** - Data transfer capacity in Mbps
- **Uptime** - Network availability percentages
- **Packet Loss** - Data transmission reliability
- **Coverage** - Geographic service areas and tower performance

### <h1sub>Network Optimization Insights</h1sub>

After completing the notebook analysis, you will understand:

- Which network regions need infrastructure investment
- Performance comparison between 5G, 4G, and 3G networks
- Optimal maintenance scheduling based on usage patterns
- Capacity planning recommendations for peak traffic periods
