# {{ getenv("EVENT_NAME","[unknown event]") }} - DataOps.live

## Why are we here?

To learn about Snowflake, with a hands on approach.

## The lab environment

A complete lab environment has been built for you automatically. This includes:

- **Snowflake Account**: {{ getenv("DATAOPS_SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT","[unknown]") }}
- **User**: {{ getenv("EVENT_USER_NAME","[unknown]") }}
- **Snowflake Virtual Warehouse**: {{ getenv("EVENT_WAREHOUSE","[unknown]") }}
- **Snowflake Database**: {{ getenv("DATAOPS_DATABASE","[unknown]") }}
- **Schema**: {{ getenv("EVENT_SCHEMA","[unknown]") }}

!!! warning "This lab environment will disappear!"

    This event is due to end at {{ getenv("EVENT_END_DATETIME","[unknown time]") }}, at which point access will be restricted, and accounts will be removed.
