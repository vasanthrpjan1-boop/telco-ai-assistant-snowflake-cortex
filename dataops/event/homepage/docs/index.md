<span style="color:#29B5E8; font-size:24px; font-family:Arial;;font-weight:bold">WHY ARE WE HERE?</span>

To learn about you can leverage the latest AI technologies right within the Snowflake platform.  When AI is deeply embedded in your trusted data platform, the possibilities are endless. We will be exploring the processing of both **Unstructured** and **Structured** data which will then allow the application of a **Cortex Agent** to help descover insights by leveraging **All Data.**

<span style="color:#29B5E8; font-size:24px; font-family:Arial;;font-weight:bold">THE LAB ENVIRONMENT</span>

A complete lab environment has been built for you automatically. This includes:

- **Snowflake Account**: [{{ getenv("DATAOPS_SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT","[unknown]") }}](https://{{ getenv("DATAOPS_SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT","[unknown]") }}.snowflakecomputing.com)
- **User**: {{ getenv("EVENT_USER_NAME","[unknown]") }}
- **Snowflake Virtual Warehouse**: {{ getenv("EVENT_WAREHOUSE","[unknown]") }}
- **Snowflake Database**: {{ getenv("DATAOPS_DATABASE","[unknown]") }}
- **Schema**: {{ getenv("EVENT_SCHEMA","[unknown]") }}



<span style="color:#29B5E8; font-size:24px; font-family:Arial;;font-weight:bold">STRUCTURE OF THE SESSION</span>

You will be taken through the AI capabilities of Snowflake with Financial Reporting data.  We will be focusing on the Snowflake Share price - and will investigating whether we should **BUY**, **SELL** or **HOLD**
