# <h1black>Create a </h1black><h1blue>Search Service</h1blue>

We now have quite a bit of unstructured data from the analyst reports and the earnings calls  - now how do we find it all? 

this is where you will build a search service.

- Go back to the home page and click on **Projects > Notebooks**

- Open the **CREATE_SEARCH_SERVICE** notebook


So we used Cortex Search to find things out about anything unstructured.  However, there will also be many datasets which we might want to include in our analysis which are infact Structured.  Some structured tables we have already processed using Document AI, but there will be other structured datasets. 

- Proceed to **Structured Data Processing** where we will start with transforming a stock prices and trading dataset from the **market place**.
