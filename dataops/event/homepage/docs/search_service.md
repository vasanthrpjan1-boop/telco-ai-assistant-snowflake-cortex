# Create a search service

We now have quite a bit of unstructured data from the analyst reports and the earnings calls  - now how do we find it all? 

this is where you will build a search service.

- Go back to the home page and click on **Projects > Notebooks**

- Open the **CREATE_SEARCH_SERVICE** notebook

- Once you have completed the search service notebook, go to **Projects > Streamlits** and open the CORTEX_SEARCH app.

- Try searching for answers using your new **Search engine** powered by **Cortex Search**

So we used Cortex Analyst, to answer questions about structured text, and we used Cortex Search to find things out about anything unstructured.   So what if we want to see all of this in one place?  Lets ask a **Cortex Agent**.

- Proceed to **Step 7**.
